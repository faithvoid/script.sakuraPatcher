# sakuraPatcher
Universal patching utility for XBMC4Xbox, which supports local .JMP &amp; .IPS patches as well as on-the-fly patch downloading and installation.

## Features
- Full .IPS support, as well as .JMP support for those using Jay's Magic Patches! (.PF & .BPS support coming soon!)
- Easily change save data, DLC data, or soundtrack data locations!
- Download and install .JMP patches directly from the Jay's Magic Patch Github repository!
- Select specifically which parts of a .JMP patch you want to install! Let's say a patch has two different options for HUD positions, you can select the one you want and rest easy!

## Installation
- TBA

## TODO
- Add method of installing additional patch files for .JMP/.PF files (ie; TDATA/UDATA modifications and the like)
- Properly implement and test .PF (XBMC4Gamers patch format) file support
- Add more configuration options for power users
- Testing, testing, testing!
